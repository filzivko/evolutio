This is a full stack web applicaiton built by Filip Zivkovic which allowed the hosting of text based articles. 
The user could input raw text and upload a photo to accompany the article. 
The website ran for a period of 6 months between late 2019 and mid 2020.
The website featured authentication passports, ssl cert, carousel article main page, and article pages.
The main aim of this project was to practice building a fullstack website, learn how to deploy and maintain it, use google analytics, implement user authorisation, etc.
The website was never used for commercial applicaitons.

Below is the orignal README from Cloud9 IDE:

Welcome to your Node.js project on Cloud9 IDE!

This chat example showcases how to use `socket.io` with a static `express` server.

## Running the server

1) Open `server.js` and start the app by clicking on the "Run" button in the top menu.

2) Alternatively you can launch the app from the Terminal:

    $ node server.js

Once the server is running, open the project in the shape of 'https://projectname-username.c9users.io/'. As you enter your name, watch the Users list (on the left) update. Once you press Enter or Send, the message is shared with all connected clients.
